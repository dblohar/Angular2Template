                    <p align="justify">
                        Organized activity aimed at imparting information and/or instructions to improve the recipient's 
                        performance or to help him or her attain a required level of knowledge or skill.
                        Training refers to the process of imparting specific skills. An employee undergoing 
                        training is presumed to have had some formal education. No training program is complete 
                        without an element of education. Hence we can say that Training is offered to operatives.

                        E-government is a generic term for web-based services from agencies of local, state and federal
                        governments. In e-government, the government uses information technology and particularly the Internet
                        to support government operations, engage citizens, and provide government services. The interaction may
                        be in the form of obtaining information, filings, or making payments and a host of other activities via 
                        the World Wide Web.
